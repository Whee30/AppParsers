These are some sample BLOBs extracted from a test device.

Group ID for the associated group chat is: 83934061

Participant IDs are:
person1: 94276828
person2: 94148535
person3: 84277446

User IDs are found at offset 0x44 for 4 bytes

Chat IDs are found at offset 0x0c for 4 bytes

In image posts, referenced image is found at offset 0x86 for 8 bytes

In image reply posts, the image being replied to is found at offset 0x135 for 8 bytes

The blobs have a definite pattern, I need to figure out how to turn this into key/value pairs
